# VQ-VAE
VQ-vae for general natural image discrete representation. It's not quite there yet (the reconstructions have too many artefacts) -- the next step is to try the exponential moving averages algorithm mentionned in the paper, or the "concrete distribution" used in DALL-E, or even switch to VQ-VAE 2.
